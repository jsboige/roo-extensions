# Context Condensation System - Documentation Index

**Date**: 2025-10-02  
**Status**: Final Consolidated Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains the complete design documentation for the refactored context condensation system in roo-code. The system uses a **provider-based architecture** with multiple implementations of increasing sophistication.

## Core Documentation (Read in Order)

### 1. [`001-current-system-analysis.md`](001-current-system-analysis.md)
**Complete Analysis of Existing System**

- Current architecture (sliding window, summarization)
- Native condensation mechanism with profiles
- Token counting and cost calculation
- Identified limitations and improvement opportunities

**Key Findings**:
- Native system uses LLM-based batch summarization
- Profile system allows per-conversation or Roo-specific configuration
- Cost varies significantly based on profile (90%+ savings possible)
- Main weakness: indiscriminate summarization loses conversation context

### 2. [`002-requirements-specification.md`](002-requirements-specification.md) ⭐ **UPDATED V2**
**Detailed Requirements for Improved System**

- Functional requirements (provider architecture, profiles, thresholds)
- Non-functional requirements (performance, cost, quality)
- Provider capabilities matrix
- Profile-aware dynamic thresholds
- Success criteria

**Key Requirements**:
- Multiple provider implementations (Native, Lossless, Truncation, Smart)
- Dynamic threshold calculation (absolute tokens or percentage)
- Profile-aware cost estimation
- Backward compatibility with existing system

### 3. [`003-provider-architecture.md`](003-provider-architecture.md) ⭐ **UPDATED V2**
**Technical Design of Provider System**

- Complete provider interface with dynamic capabilities
- Provider manager and lifecycle
- Profile integration and threshold management
- Native provider implementation (wraps existing system)
- Cost calculation methodology
- Surface of responsibility (Provider vs Manager)

**Key Concepts**:
- `ICondensationProvider` interface
- `CondensationProviderManager` orchestrator
- Profile-aware `estimateCost()` and threshold handling
- Clear separation: Provider = technical, Manager = business logic

### 4. [`004-provider-implementations.md`](004-provider-implementations.md) ⭐ **UPDATED V2**
**All Provider Implementations & Condensation Strategies**

Complete documentation of all 4 providers:

**A. Native Provider** (Backward Compatible)
- Wraps existing LLM-based batch summarization
- Profile-aware (conversation vs Roo profile)
- Dynamic cost calculation

**B. Lossless Provider** (Zero Information Loss)
- File read deduplication
- Tool result consolidation
- Obsolete state removal

**C. Truncation Provider** (Fast & Simple)
- Age-based selection
- Mechanical truncation/suppression
- Configurable thresholds

**D. Smart Provider** (Multi-Pass, Ultra-Configurable)
- Pass-based configuration model
- Three content types (message text, tool params, tool results)
- Four operations (keep, suppress, truncate, summarize)
- Batch or individual processing modes
- Conditional execution (always or threshold-based)
- Full UI configuration system

**Key Innovation**: Pass-based architecture allows expressing any condensation strategy through configuration.

### 5. [`005-implementation-roadmap.md`](005-implementation-roadmap.md) ⭐ **UPDATED V2**
**Step-by-Step Implementation Plan**

- 8-week phased implementation
- Week 1-2: Foundation (interfaces, manager, Native provider)
- Week 3-4: Simple providers (Lossless, Truncation)
- Week 5-7: Smart provider (pass system, UI)
- Week 8: Testing, optimization, rollout
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Success metrics per phase

## Working Documents (Historical Context)

These documents contain the evolution of thinking and detailed explorations that informed the final design:

- `004-bis-progressive-strategy.md` - Early exploration of V1/V2/V3 progressive approach (superseded by pass-based model)
- `006-provider-implementations.md` - Initial provider designs (consolidated into 004 V2)
- `007-native-system-deep-dive.md` - Deep analysis of native system profiles and cost (integrated into 001 and 003)
- `008-refined-pass-architecture.md` - Detailed pass-based architecture (consolidated into 004 V2)

**Note**: These working documents are kept for historical context but are superseded by the consolidated V2 versions of documents 002-004.

## Quick Start Guide

**For Understanding**:
1. Read 001 (current system)
2. Read 002 (what we want)
3. Read 003 (how providers work)
4. Read 004 (all provider implementations)

**For Implementation**:
1. Follow 005 (roadmap)
2. Reference 003 (architecture) for interfaces
3. Reference 004 (implementations) for detailed algorithms

## Key Concepts Summary

### Provider Architecture
- **Interface**: `ICondensationProvider` with dynamic cost estimation
- **Manager**: `CondensationProviderManager` handles orchestration
- **Profiles**: Each provider can use different API profiles with different costs/thresholds
- **Thresholds**: Can be specified as absolute tokens OR percentage of profile limit

### Content Model (Smart Provider)
- **Message Text**: User/assistant natural language
- **Tool Parameters**: Input to tool calls
- **Tool Results**: Output from tool execution

### Operations (Smart Provider)
- **KEEP**: Preserve unchanged
- **SUPPRESS**: Remove entirely
- **TRUNCATE**: Mechanical reduction
- **SUMMARIZE**: LLM-based semantic reduction

### Execution Modes (Smart Provider)
- **Batch**: Process all messages as block (like native)
- **Individual**: Process each message/content independently

### Pass Execution (Smart Provider)
- **Always**: Execute sequentially (systematic refinement)
- **Conditional**: Execute only if tokens > threshold (fallback)

## Configuration Examples

### Simple: Lossless + Truncation
```typescript
provider: 'truncation'
config: {
  preserveRecentCount: 5,
  maxToolResultLines: 5
}
```

### Advanced: Multi-Pass Smart
```typescript
provider: 'smart'
config: {
  losslessPrelude: { enabled: true },
  passes: [
    { /* Pass 1: truncate old tool results */ },
    { /* Pass 2: LLM summarize if still over threshold */ },
    { /* Pass 3: batch fallback */ }
  ]
}
```

## Success Metrics

- **Flexibility**: ✓ Any strategy expressible through configuration
- **Performance**: ✓ <100ms (truncation) to ~5s (smart with LLM)
- **Cost**: ✓ $0 (truncation) to ~$0.05 (smart with heavy LLM)
- **Quality**: ✓ Configurable trade-off between speed/cost/quality
- **Compatibility**: ✓ Native provider wraps existing system

## Migration Path

**Phase 1**: Foundation + Native Provider (backward compatible)
**Phase 2**: Add Lossless + Truncation (new capabilities)
**Phase 3**: Add Smart Provider (power users)
**Phase 4**: User testing and optimization
